Urban Heat Island intensity analysis of Kolkata (2015–2025) using Landsat 8 &amp; 9 LST data and QGIS.
# Urban Heat Island Intensity Analysis – Kolkata (2015–2025)

## Overview
This project analyzes the temporal variation and spatial intensity of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Kolkata, India, between 2015 and 2025 using satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) data.

The study employs Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 thermal imagery processed in QGIS to assess decadal changes in surface temperature and urban thermal stress.

## Objectives
- Derive Land Surface Temperature (LST) for 2015 and 2025
- Map and classify Urban Heat Island intensity zones
- Conduct change detection analysis
- Identify high-risk urban thermal hotspots
- Discuss planning and climate mitigation implications

## Data & Tools
- Satellite Data: Landsat 8 (2015), Landsat 9 (2025)
- Thermal Band: Band 10
- Spatial Resolution: 30 m (resampled)
- Software: QGIS 3.40
- Data Source: USGS Earth Explorer

## Methodology
1. Satellite data acquisition
2. Radiometric and atmospheric correction
3. Conversion of DN to radiance and brightness temperature
4. Emissivity correction
5. Land Surface Temperature (LST) derivation
6. UHI classification
7. Change detection analysis

## Key Findings
- Mean surface temperature increased by **2.57°C**
- Maximum surface temperature rose by **3.77°C**
- High and very high UHI zones expanded by **13.7%**
- Core urban and eastern sectors experienced the highest warming
- River-adjacent and wetland zones showed relative cooling

## Policy Relevance
- Supports SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)
- Supports SDG 13 (Climate Action)
- Highlights need for green infrastructure, cool roofs, and wetland protection
